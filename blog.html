 <p>Had a semi productive weekend. Configured zfs on my server, got my dns records working (You can offically got to agonser.xyz now). I also went to the Japanese cultural festive in Saginaw. That was alot of fun, should have some pictures up on facebook.  I am currently trying to set up nfs on my the same ubuntu server so I can easily mount and transfer things, in particular from my apple xserve.  The plan is to get everything off of that and onto my new server and then maybe turn the xserve into a xen-server, but I am running into some permissions issues.  My boy Jason showed me this really cool project called ngrok, will be using that to work on things through the coming week.

  <p>Post 2: Electric Boogaloo.  Bare with me as I work through what I want this blog to be. Yesterday was pretty cool. I went to my first M/U/G (aka Michigan Unix users Group) meeting. It was a lecture on the life of a "mediocre programmer". Was pretty a pretty cool talk and I won the door prize of the No Starch Press text book, "Elequent Javascript", so hopefully I can use that to make this site better. So here's to that!  In other news I hope to get this docker thing figured out on this digital ocean droplet I purchased the other day.  Having some trouble with it and pushing my changes to github and then getting the makerfile to work correctly after that. Still scratching my head, hopefully I can get some input from the coffee house coders guys.
