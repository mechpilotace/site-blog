This is my personal site project. 

I am using this as a learning tool to teach myself, git/version control, and full stack development.

This is going to be sloppy at first so bare with me.  

I will add interesing tid bits and gotchas as I deem nessiary to this README, but it is mostly so the git page looks a little nicer. 

Cheers!
